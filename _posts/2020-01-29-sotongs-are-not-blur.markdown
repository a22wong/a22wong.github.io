You should know that sotong (the Bahasa Melayu word for squid) are members of the [cephalopod][cephalopod-definition] class of animals, which, are considered to be "exceptionally intelligent vertibrates" accordining to [this Wikipedia article on cephalopod intelligence][cephalopod-intelligence-article]. Other cephalopods include octopuses and nautili.

The irony behind the iconic and idomatic Singlish phrase "blur like sotong" is the rationale behind the title, among other things.

Be like the titular sotong, I implore you. Be adaptive, resiliant, inuitive, creative. And among it all, accept that you don't know everything - that you will always have blur moments - and let that be your strength rather than your weakness.
